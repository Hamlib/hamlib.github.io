# Ham Radio Control Library

### Welcome to Hamlib!

The Ham Radio Control Library--Hamlib, for short--is a project to provide
programs with a consistent Application Programming Interface (API) for
controlling the myriad of radios and rotators available to amateur
radio and communications users.

#### Mailing list

- [Subscribe](https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib/lists/hamlib-developer)
- [GMANE list archive via NNTP](nntp://news.gmane.io/gmane.linux.hams.hamlib.devel)

**Note:** The prior GMANE Web interface is likely permanently offline.  A new
GMANE NNTP server is operational and recent list mail can be seen via the
news.gmane.io server (note the new host name which became active on 15 Jan
2020) as the gmane.linux.hams.hamlib.devel group.  At this time the mail
gateway from the GMANE news server to the mailing list doesn't seem to be
operational.  See [news.gmane.org is now
news.gmane.io](https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/2020/01/15/news-gmane-org-is-now-news-gmane-io/)
for more information on the recent change.

### Contributing

Hamlib has a very organic development model.  Contributions
([patches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing))) are accepted
after review and applied to the development branch
([master](https://github.com/Hamlib/Hamlib)), or, in the case of a bug fix to
a released version, an arbitrary stable branch.

Patches may be submitted by one of several ways.  Perhaps the most common is
[forking](https://help.github.com/search/?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=forking) the
[Hamlib](https://github.com/Hamlib/Hamlib) repository, making the changes to
your cloned repository and then issuing a [pull
request](https://help.github.com/search/?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=pull+request).

Not to worry, the GitHub site (which hosts this page and repository) has plenty
of help available to keep all of this straight.

Another way to submit patches is to post them to the mailing list where Nate,
N0NB, will likely apply them and push them to the main repository.  The
[README.developer
file](https://github.com/Hamlib/Hamlib/blob/master/README.developer) has some
additional information.

Contributions to Hamlib come from all over the world, it seems.  It is this
widespread interest that keeps the project moving forward.  Don't be shy if
all of this seems a bit overwhelming.  All of us were beginners at some point
as well, so dig in and have fun!
